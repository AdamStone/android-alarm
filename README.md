# android-alarm

The beginnings of an alarm clock app developed in Android's old Eclipse SDK. This was mainly an exercise to reinforce what I had been learning in the [Programming Mobile Applications for Android](https://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart1) course on Coursera. It was good practice, but I decided to set it aside to focus on learning javascript-based web applications. I'll probably return to it at some point.
